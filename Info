simple linear regression : we predict the value of Y(independent variable) based on the variable X(dependent variable). 
Examine the relationship between only 2 variables only. 
Independent or dependent variable increases or decreased based on the linear fashion.
ex : If the employee years of experience increases the salary also increases in linear fashion
     Y = mX + B      (m represents slop of the line and B represents 
     Salary = m (years of experience) + B  
     
     m and B are co-efficients .  (goal is to obtain the best values of m and B or best fit the data points)

Multiple linear regression: examine relation between more than 2 variables
    y = b0 + m1*x1 + m2*x2 + .... mn*xn
    
    salary dependence on no.of years experience and no.of years education.  
    y = b0 + m1 * no.of years experience + m2 * no.of years education (goal is to obtain m1 , m2 and b)
    
    
Polynominal Regression: the relation between x and y at nth degree of polynomial x.
      y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x1pow2 + b3* x1pow3 + ... +bn* x1pown
